## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any significant bugs or security vulnerabilities to [Graham Watson](graham@phantomwatson.com).

While the Vore Arts Fund does not have the means to operate a bug bounty program, we _will_ sing your praises and tell the story of your heroism for the next three generations, after which your legend will be obscured in the fog of our ancestral memory and some will come to question whether you were ever real or merely a figuritive paragon to whose unimpeachable character we should all aspire.
