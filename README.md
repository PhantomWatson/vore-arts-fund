## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the website running on your machine for development and testing purposes. See [Deployment](#deployment) for instructions on deploying the project to a live system.

### Prerequisites

- [Composer](https://book.cakephp.org/3/en/installation.html#installing-composer)
    - see `composer.phar` to see the components Composer will provide you with
- IDE of choice - [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended
- **Linux:** MySQL DBMS, Apache HTTP Server
- **Windows and MacOS:** [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp)

### Installing

1. Clone the repo.
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/BallStateCBER/vore-arts-fund.git
    ```
1. Create the file `config/.env` using `config/.env.default` as a template. Be sure to fill out empty export fields in your new file.
    ```bash
    $ cp config/.env.default config/.env
    ```
1. Use Composer to install CakePHP, PHP, Twilio SDK.
    ```bash
    $ composer install && composer update && composer dump-autoload --optimize
    ```
1. Set up your database structure. Be sure to have your MySQL instance running.
    ```bash
    $ bin\cake migrations migrate
    ```
1. Give executable permissions to `bin/cake`
    - Linux/MacOS:
        ```bash
        $ chmod +x bin/cake
        ```
    - Windows: the provided `.bat` file should be executable without changes
1. Start your [development server](https://book.cakephp.org/3/en/installation.html#development-server)
    ```bash
    $ bin/cake server
    ```

### Using Docker
1. In a CLI, navigate to `/docker` and run `./build.sh` to build Docker images and start containers
1. Add the following files to your `hosts` file
   ```
   127.0.0.1	vore.test
   127.0.0.1	www.vore.test
   ```
1. In a browser, open `http://vore.text:9000`

If the SSL certificate is working, `https://` can be used instead.

## Testing

### End-to-End Testing

1. Set the 3 TESTING_DATABASE_... fields in your `config/.env` file.
    ```php
    export TESTING_DATABASE_NAME=""
    export TESTING_DATABASE_USERNAME=""
    export TESTING_DATABASE_PASSWORD=""
    ```
1. Run the tests through phpunit (installed for you by Composer).
    ```bash
    $ vendor/bin/phpunit
    ```
