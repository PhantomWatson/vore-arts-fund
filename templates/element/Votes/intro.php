    To better bridge the gap between the public, working artists, and nonprofits, the Vore Arts Fund makes its funding decisions through a public vote. In every funding cycle, anyone can submit a ranked-choice voting ballot to tell us how to prioritize all eligible applications. Then, we'll spend that cycle's budget funding as many projects as we can, and in the order determined by those votes.
