            What is the Vore Arts Fund?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Vore Arts Fund is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit company incorporated in 2020 to financially support the arts
            and entertainment community of Muncie, Indiana. It distributes no-contract, no-interest loans to cover the
            up-front costs of producing for-profit art, music, performances, and art education.
        </p>
        <p>
            By absorbing the financial risk inherent in arts-related projects with up-front costs, this program makes it
            easier for artists, educators, performers, and promoters to improve the quality-of-place of our community.
            By distributing loans instead of grants and targeting for-profit projects, this program can operate without
            depending on an ongoing fundraising effort. In the future, we hope to grow it to also distribute grants to
            support noncommercial art endeavors, such as public murals, free performances, and free art classes.

            Who's eligible?
        </h2>
        <p>
            To apply for funding, you must be a resident of Muncie, Indiana, at least 18, and seeking support for the
            up-front costs of an arts-related project that is expected to generate enough money to pay back those costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more details about who qualifies, refer to the <a href="/terms#eligibility">eligibility requirements</a>
            section of our Terms of Service page.

            How are funding decisions made?
        </h2>
        <p>
            A review committee reviews all applications to make sure they meet our eligibility requirements, and any
            accepted applications are presented to the public to vote on, using ranked-choice voting. Once the voting period
            is over, the money budgeted for that funding cycle gets distributed to the highest-ranked application, followed
            by the second-highest, and so on until that cycle's budget is spent. In other words,
            <strong>the public determines our funding priorities</strong>.

            What are the loan repayment terms?
        </h2>
        <p>
            No interest is charged for any loans, but recipients are encouraged to add "voluntary interest" to their
            repayment (kind of like adding gratuity) to help our program continue to grow. Until your loan is

        <h2>
            What if my funded project fails?
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the event a funded project fails to generate enough money to repay a loan, that loan can be unconditionally
            forgiven. The Vore Arts Fund accepts the risk of your project potentially failing, and that helps you, the
            artist, to focus on your work without worrying about whether it will bankrupt you.
