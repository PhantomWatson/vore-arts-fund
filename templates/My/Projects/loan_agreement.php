The Vore Arts Fund is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation created to support the Muncie, Indiana, arts community by distributing funds to cover the up-front costs of producing for-profit art, music, theater, and art education.
By absorbing the financial risk inherent in art-related projects with up-front costs, this program makes it easier for artists, educators, performers, and promoters to improve the quality-of-place of our community. In the future, we hope to grow the fund so that it may also distribute grants to support noncommercial art endeavors, such as public murals, free performances, and free art classes.
