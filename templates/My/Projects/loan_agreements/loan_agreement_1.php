        The borrower agrees to repay the lender the loan amount in full, whether in a single payment or in installments, by the due date. Payments can be made electronically through the Vore Arts Fund's website or made by checks mailed to and made out to Vore Arts Fund, Inc.

    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Overpayment:</strong>
        Any payment beyond the amount of the loan given to the borrower will be considered a donation to the Vore Arts Fund, and these donations can be used as a tax deduction. If you need the receipt of the donation, please reach out to the Vore Arts Fund.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Failure To Make Payments:</strong>
        Through the mission of the Vore Arts Fund, if the borrower is unable to repay the loan, the unpaid portion will be forgiven upon the passage of the due date or upon written notification by the borrower that they are unable to repay. A forgiven loan will be reported to the IRS as taxable income for the borrower if the unpaid portion meets or exceeds the minimum amount required for reporting.
